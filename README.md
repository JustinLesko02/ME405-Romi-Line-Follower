## Electrical Design
This section describes the electrical design of our line following robot.
###
Our electrical design is fairly standard for ROMI line following robots. All of our components are plugged into a nucleo development board, which receives power from a ROMI PDB. Shown below is our wiring diagram.

Of note, due to the number of devices used in this project, most 5V and GND connections were made on a section of perf board instead of plugging directly into the nucleo board.

## Mechanical Design

The mechanical design for our line follower is a modified version of the standard ROMI POLULU chassis kit. 
The main modifications we made were 3D printed mounts for the IMU, bump sensors, and
